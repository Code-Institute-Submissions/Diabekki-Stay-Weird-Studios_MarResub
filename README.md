 ## Testing
- Issues faced
    - An error causing the marchandise to show a server error (locally this was solved but upon deployment it returned error 500)
    - In relation to the clothing when selecting sizes the page showed an error that it was unable to find the merchandise (locally this was fixed but upon deployment it returned an error 500)
    - Comments are returning an error, I believe this is a database issue in relation to migrations after deployment to heroku. 
    - Stripe payments stopped working at an unknown point in development, after reviewing with my peers this seemed to be a common issue after deployment to heroku.

- JavaScript issues
    - Initally there was an issue when adding or removing multiples of an item. This error is fixed.

- Deployment Issues
    - Heroku deployment caused many issues that I did not have the time available to fix. I believe that it is a database issue and that the data did not automaticly deploy as is should when pushed.
 
    ![image of heroku email of failure](media/heroku-failure-email.JPG)   

- User testing
    - through a personal group-chat I sent the deployed website to friends and family and received feedback from various devices.
    - I had review the page to give me opinions on further development. 

- Summary
    - In summary locally the website worked well and was fully functional. Upon deployment what I expect to be a database issue has cause most models to fail functionally.  

the resolutions I have tested the website on are as follows 
- Desktop screen
    - 1024px & up width
- Laptop
    - 769px-1024px width
- Tablet
    - 481px-768px width
- Mobile 
    - 320px-480px width

## Acknowledgements

I want to thank my Fiance who kept pushing me to keep bettering myself and not letting me give up and for giving me advice on how get the readme to sound more structured and professional.
Fellow students for letting me vent frustrations when I felt overwhelmed with the work and helping deal with the emotional pressure of course work not going as planned.
I did not have a mentor through this project due to previous issues so I had to do this project more so on my own.
